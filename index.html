        <p>
            This paper deals with a problem of describing massively-multiplayer-online-role-playing games in a computer readable format,
            such as an ontology. The ontology used in this paper will describe the conceptual model of an mmorpg, model that is based on entities, attributes, relationships and axioms.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) are a combination
            of ​role-playing video games ​ and ​massively multiplayer online games ​ in which a very
            large number of ​players ​ interact with one another within a ​virtual world ​.
            As in all ​RPGs ​, the player assumes the role of a ​character ​ (often in a ​fantasy
            world ​ or ​science-fiction ​ world) and takes control over many of that character's actions.
            MMORPGs are distinguished from ​single-player ​ or small ​multiplayer ​ online RPGs by the
            number of players able to interact together, and by the game's ​persistent world ​ (usually
            hosted by the game's ​publisher ​), which continues to exist and evolve while the player
            is ​offline ​ and away from the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main idea of this paper is creation
            of an ontological model suitable for description of a
            massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Motivation for the development of this kind of model comes from the needs of having a solid model base 
            for creating an instance of this game category.
            Ontology of this kind would contain all the relevant, or even
            better, all obtainable information about the game, the participant actors and the relations between them. And such a description model might
            be successfully used when describing a new game or a new environment.

                    A character is created by an account user and is generally characterized by
                    aspects such as:
                    <li>class</li> 
                    <li>level: generally a numeric value indicating character advance on o value scale</li>

                    <li>equipment, money (virtual)</li> 
                    <li>belonging to certain groups</li>
                    Generally, much of the game time is dedicated to improving the level,
                    skills and possessions of the character.

                    NPCs are entities that populate the virtual world and are not under control user.
                    NPCs are not generally enemies that have to be destroyed, but have a more varied role
                    for example, they may be used to: Implementing certain dialogs with predefined variants
                    within its quests to assist the user to offer certain products or services within the game
                     companions that help the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another entity of NPCs types is the "mob" entity. The term "mob" refers to entities with which the user is somewhat bound by
                    the logic of the game to confront them to meet certain objectives or get some resources.
                    For example, at the time of destroying a monster, one user can get a certain
                    amount of gold or virtual objects on which the monster contains them. Destruction of
                    monsters may be a prerequisite for advancement quests, etc. Monsters have the most
                    varied representations: animals, aliens, characters humanoid, etc. ​Also, monsters can
                    have different levels, strength and abilities, making it harder or more easily destroyed.
                    The actions of these entities are coordinated by the system, generally with the help very
                    simple decision-making elements.

                    A quest is a suite of actions that the user has to accomplish to get a reward
                    within the virtual world. Actions can be removing a number of monsters of a certain
                    type, removing one a very powerful monster, going out of a labyrinth, searching for and
                    finding an object in particular, assembling an object from components, etc. As a rule,
                    during quests, the user is guided by an NPC, explaining what he has to do, and
                    sometimes giving him help. Quests can be individual, team-level or guild.

                    Each character may have certain virtual resources that he or she has absolute
                    or limited rights in that game.
                    E.g:
                    <li>Weapons</li> 
                    <li> special equipment</li>
                    <li>money</li> 
                    <li>various resources</li> 
                    <li>land</li>
                    He may use, modify, sell or destroy his assets. The concept of virtual
                    resource also led to the creation of systems exchange / trading.

                This ontology was created manually, adding every enity in an individual way. For the best analysis, it is recommended to use an automated process to populate the ontology.
                Ontology providing description as shown in this paper can be sufficient to give us an overview of games in the category MMORPG. 
                Each character can have certain common quantitative features (statistics)
                that we modeled via datatype properties. For example, a character has lifePoints
                (Health Points), manaPoints alos known as Magic Points, dexterity points, strength points, experience Points and level represented by a number.
                Also, every character has a gender (male or female) and a type (playable or
                non-playable). Base on this we have the FemaleType, MaleType, WarriorType, MageType, ShamanType and two subclasses: PlayerCharacter, NonPlayerCharacter(NPC). 
                So in this ontology the player character may have the the following classes: Warrior, Mage, Shaman, Assasin and can interact with the other actors in game (other players, monsters, NPCs).
                A NPC can be a monster or just an static character.

            <h2>Conclusion & Future considerations</h2>
            <p>
                This ontology was created manually, adding every enity individually. For the best analysis, it is recommended to use an automated process to populate the ontology.
                Ontology providing description as shown in this paper can be sufficient to give us an overview of games in the category MMORPG. 
                That way, ontology will be used as a knowledge model for developing an specific mmorpg game.
